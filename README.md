# Kotlin examples
## Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests

### Examples from Advanced Topics Parts
Examples for `Testing Persistence`, `Unit Testing and Threads` and `Testing Asynchronyous Code`.

For **Testing Persistence** part the following libs were used:

- [test containers](https://www.testcontainers.org/)
- [kotlin-allopen](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#all-open-compiler-plugin) plugin
- [kotlin-jpa](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#jpa-support) plugin


The **sniper-auction** app is in a [different](https://github.com/dehasi/sniper-auction) repo.

### Attention

I'm not a professional Kotlin developer. 
If you can rewrite it in more kotlin-idiomatic style pull requests are welcome!
